# Churn_Prediction
This project uses Kaggleâ€™s Bank Customer Churn dataset to predict customers likely to leave using machine learning models like KNN, SVM, Regression, and GBC. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model evaluation, and optimization to improve churn prediction accuracy.

Key components of the project:
      Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering: Cleaning and transforming data for better model performance.
      Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing customer data to find trends and patterns that could indicate churn.
      Model Building & Evaluation: Training multiple machine learning models and comparing their performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
      Model Optimization: Fine-tuning models to improve prediction accuracy.
